VCD standard compliance
=======================

The VCD grammar we used is as specified by the 2017 SystemVerilog 4 state standard.
The main purpose of the library is to parse IVerilog VCD generated dumps and is
the only simulator whose format we will adapt our parser for while trying to
maintain standard correctness.

Grammar problems of VCD
-----------------------

* Poorly defined what counts as whitespace and where it is allowed.
  Implementation chose the following characters as whitespace: ``' '``, ``'\n'``,
  ``'\r'``, ``'\t'``, ``'\v'``, ``'\f'``.  We also tried to allow and require
  whitespace where we thought reasonable.
* Used ``binary_value`` instead of ``binary_number`` in ``binary_value_change``
  since there is clearly not a double ``b`` in any examples or output of
  simulators.
* The wording says that the ``real`` number should be dumped with ``%.16g``, but
  the grammar specifies ``real_number`` which does not allow numbers like ``2``
  which can be exactly represented by ``2`` and subsequently output by ``printf``
  as such. Implementation allows numbers without decimal points or exponent.

Things we are uncertain about:
------------------------------
* Whether or not a variable must fall within a scope. Implementation chose to
  not allow.
* Whether or not more than one root scope is allowed. Implementation chose to
  not allow.
* Multiple references are allowed to point to the same identifier code, but
  the references does not necesarily have the same variable type. Things like
  ``reg`` and ``wire`` can have the same identifier code, but ``real`` and ``wire``
  make things difficult since ``real``'s are specified with ``real_value_change``
  and ``wire``'s aren't. The standard does not appear to offer any guidance in
  this case. Implementation chose to allow everything to alias eachother
  except ``real``'s. References sharing the same identifier code always has to
  have the same size.

IVerilog quirks
---------------

* In IVerilog generate blocks creates scopes whose identifier contain ``[`` and
  ``]`` which is not allowed by the standard. For compatibility we used
  ``reference`` as the scope's ``identifier``.
